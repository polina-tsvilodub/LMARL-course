Please note that the provided Colab computational resources are free, so please be mindful when using them. Further, Colab monitors GPU usage, so if it is used a lot very frequently, the user might not be able to access GPU run times for a while. \n",

    "The following basic exercises are to recap the use of pretrained LLMs via the transformers library and get a feeling for LLMs' capabilities when it comes to properties of agents. Please make sure to read through the following code and tasks carefully and make sure you understand all the terms and what the code does."
