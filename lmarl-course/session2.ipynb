    "> 1. One of the modules in cognitive architectures is perception, which interacts with memory. Core functionality of these subprocesses in human cogntion is categorization, i.e., assigning discrete categories to perceived stimuli, based on our knowledge (memory) of different categories. While ML models are highly accurate at categorization tasks, they need large amounts of training data that is implausible from a cognitive perspective. Please follow [this tutorial](https://alanjern.github.io/computational-psych-book/04-categorization.html) to see an example of a model from cognitive psychology where categorization happens based on a smaller number of examples."
