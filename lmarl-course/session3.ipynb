    "    1. efficiency: e.g., learning things that would take too long to discover for an individual agent (e.g., mathematical theory) or too costly to discover for an individual; experts can guide the learner through most efficient paths\n",

We have seen an example of a Bayesian model in the context of category prediction, whoch built on an intuitive model of how categories are constructed. This model was used to infer likely category of an observation via Bayesian inference.

    "4. Try to come up with a reward formalizing the goal of successfully navigating from the classroom to, e.g., your home. Which aspects are more difficult to formalize, which are easier? How does this relate to considerations of AI safety?\n",
    "    1. examples: easy: rewarding the quick minimization of distance towards the goal (i.e., navigating in the right direction), difficult: correctly generalizing to unforseen situations\n",
    "    2. these considerations relate to the difficulty of correct reward specification for agents that are supposed to be employed in the real world, therefore highlighting the difficulty of building AI systems that are safe across the board\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the difference between reward misspecification and reward hacking? Provide a conceivable example of reward hacking in the context of LMs.\n",
    "    1. Reward misspecification occurs when the specified reward function does not accurately capture the true objective or desired behavior. Reward hacking refers to the behavior of RL agents exploiting gaps or loopholes in the specified reward function to achieve high rewards without actually fulfilling the intended objectives. As was mentioned in the discussion, one can view reward hacking as a possible (specific) result of reward misspecification. A useful (optional) resource for learning more is, e.g., [this blogpost](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/ai-safety-101-reward-misspecification). \n",

    "In practical terms, the Gymnasium environment / package is one of the most practical tools for training RL models. Using the following tutorial, you will learn the basics of the environment with a basic task from RL, the multu-armed bandit task. In this task, the agent has to learn the rewards associated with a finite set of choice options (or, arms) through making repeated choices. \n",
